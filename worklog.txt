delete on item in the basket:

ok, so keys in the basket are not Product ids
they are ProductInventory ids

some products are crashing on delete from cart

both incense and book can be added to the cart, but only book can be deleted:
DEBUG basket_delete POST: <QueryDict: {'productid': ['2'], 'csrfmiddlewaretoken': ['zfc7wGCMU5XOUO4YBpRC4LniakXOQDWhm4xE0z5jnPlAGadfuMc14IOXw60IDXnn'], 'action': ['post']}>

^ it has this productid, while incense does not:

delete-button there is missing value for data-index!
there's a single #cartitems div with two 'card' children divs, one has data-index, the other does not
both have:
 data-index="{{product.id}}
 so looks like on of the products is missing the id

need to remove $ from product category list and individual product details - or rather replace with a list of prices
