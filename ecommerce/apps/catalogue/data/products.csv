<h3>Excerpts from the Translator's Introduction:</h3>
<p>
Saint John (Father John Sergiev) of Kronstadt (1828-1909) is one of
the best-known modern Russian saints. His classic chronicle of the
spiritual life<em> My Life in Christ</em> was translated into English and
French at the beginning of the twentieth century. Despite the interest
St. John sparked during his lifetime and in recent scholarship and
theology however many of his sermons and essays remain unknown
outside their original Russian. This translation of <em>The Homilies on
the Beatitudes</em> is meant to introduce the English language reader
to a fundamental hitherto neglected part of the saint's work.
<p>
This work dates from St. John's early period when he was
known primarily in Kronstadt and its environs. St. John appears here
still as a local parish priest intimately concerned with the life and
behavior of his immediate flock; he is not yet the famous healer
political commentator and philanthropist he would become in only a
decade. We have little surviving material from this period
(1858-1880) when St. John was engaged in the day-to-day work of
charity prayer and asceticism that would eventually earn him the
gifts of healing and wonderworking. <em>The Homilies</em> are thus of
interest both as a document chronicling the first steps of a saint
towards holiness before broad recognition and acclaim and also as a
text which is hardly accessible even in its original.

<p>
The text's interest however lies beyond its rarity. For students of
St. John <em>The Homilies</em> are useful precisely for the links they
allow one to make between his early works and his later better-known
ones. Such themes as charity and the sacraments for example can
already be identified as being among the saint's central and pervasive
concerns appearing as early as 1869 and worked out by him to the end
of his life.
<p>
<em>The Homilies</em> also constitute a link between St. John's diaries
preserved in Russian archives&#151;only a minuscule portion of
which is contained in <em>My Life in Christ</em>&#151;and his sermons. If
the Homilies are compared with the notes St.John made in his diaries
at the same time for example certain phrases and even entire
sections are reproduced word for word. Wherever possible this book
will note such parallels referring the reader to the original
source. For the Homilies are the public expression of St. John's
private thoughts... As a side-by-side reading of the diaries
and the Homilies shows St. John would first note an idea privately
then ponder on it and present it for public use in the form of a
sermon. His works demonstrate that the boundary between public and
private for a saint and a priest could be quite porous.
<p>
Because <em>The Homilies</em> were as the name suggests originally
delivered as sermons they give the reader an unusually close sense of
the impact of St. John's physical presence and his spoken word. His
using examples that would have been familiar to his audience his
structuring each homily to remind the listeners of the previous week's
lesson his frequent exclamations of <Q>Brothers!</Q>all heighten the
sense that this was an oral presentation and that both speaker and
listeners inspired each other with their own fervor.

<p>
...But above all the Homilies are an invitation to the
Liturgy. St. John's preaching genius which eluded those of his
contemporaries who tried to identify it comes through eloquently
here. By concentrating on a simple and basic text which he notes is
<Q>read or chanted</Q> every day he illuminates the entire Divine service.
<p>
...Far from being a detached moralizing meditation on the
Gospel in short St. John's <em>Homilies on the Beatitudes</em> are a document
to uniquely Orthodox teachings practices and even calendar days
testifying that to him the Gospel's lessons could be apprehended only
in the context of Orthodox liturgy. Reading <em>The Homilies</em> brings us
closer both to St. John and the Orthodox Church he loved and served.

They are used in thousands of hymns in the Menaion Triodion Pentecostarion Octoechos and other service books of the Church. Until now it has not been possible to learn them without a trained instructor.
<p />
<em>Byzantine Prosomia the Chanter's Companion</em> makes it possible to learn study and practice  the execution of these special melodies outside of formal choral instruction. For every track on the 2 CD's two examples of each Prosomion are chanted in English clearly and simply. At the beginning of each track one of the chanters announces each Prosomion by saying the title and the tone used thus eliminating the need to refer to the CD label and making the set suitable for use while traveling in a car.
<p />
In addition a PDF file of the music (in Western notation) with texts for all the Prosomia is provided on the second CD. A second PDF file has the music for all the Prosomia without words. The music  for any of the Prosomia may be printed out and words of  hymns written in as needed. Both of these files are also available for download below.
<p />
The selections are augmented beyond what is only in the Greek Menaia. For example some are taken from services to Saint Seraphim of Sarov Saint John of Kronstadt Saint Patrick Saint John Maximovitch the Holy Martyrs of China and others.

<p />
Why are Orthodox Christians divided into those who follow
the ""Old Calendar"" and the ""New Calendar?"" How did the
""New Calendar"" come into being? Why was it adopted by the
State Church of Greece in 1924 and under what circumstances? <em>The Struggle Against Ecumenism</em> was written to
answer these questions. It provides a history of the events in
Greece that led to the adoption of the ""New"" or ""Gregorian""
Calendar in 1924 how the traditional Orthodox Christians of
Greece opposed it and what they suffered because of it. It is
the most complete such history in the English language and
provides the texts of many original documents-the writings
and encyclicals of those responsible for adopting the New
Calendar and of those who led the opposition to it-so that
the faithful can judge for themselves. Its purpose is to furnish
a detailed chronicle of the ""Old Calendar Movement"" in
Greece and by extension America and to demonstrate that the New Calendar was adopted as part of the larger program of Ecumenism which seeks to unite the Orthodox Church with all other denominations and even religions and has brought disaster to those who have participated in it.",,
