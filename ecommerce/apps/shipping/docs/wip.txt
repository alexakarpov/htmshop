Basket.toJSON:

  [{"price": "20.00",
        "qty": 2,
        "variant": "",
        "title": "Prayer Book"},
       {"price": "30.00",
        "qty": 1,
        "variant": "8x10",
        "title": "Holy Napkin"},
  ]

book (no variants) weight is know from product/catalog

for the rest, variant + type is enougho for weight calculation,
but requires type to get to the cart (alternatively, type can be
inferred from the variant value)

the other approach is to have SKU table with weight/size/other metadata,
and cart to contain just the sku's key (this requires add-to-cart, done
based on the catalogue, to translate the choice to the SKU)
