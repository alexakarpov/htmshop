cart looks like this:

a new bug: in checkout/views 287 due to tier_name being an actual service code, which is potentially longer than 20

    choices = session.get("purchase").get("delivery_choice")
    _, shipping_cost, tier_name = choices.split("/")


To make recovery in case of failure easier, an additional sshd will 
be started on port '1022'. If anything goes wrong with the running 
ssh you can still connect to the additional one. 
If you run a firewall, you may need to temporarily open this port. As 
this is potentially dangerous it's not done automatically. You can 
open the port with e.g.: 
'iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1022 -j ACCEPT'
