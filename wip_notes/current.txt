when we render the url:

checkout/deliverychoices

, we don't have the choices yet,
because we get them from our own "api" endpoint,
at shipping/get-routes, AFTER we load the page, because we need
to spin a "loading" circle until ShipEngine gets the data

Therefore, the data from SE can be processed in get-rates,
(called by AJAX from checkout/deliverychoices on load),
but that won't be present in Django context, so template renderer
can't "build" the page.

we know we will have 3 tiers, Regular, Fast and Expedited,
but not price or days
thus we can load three incomplete divs in Django,
and later populate them with data from JS:

{name: 'Economy', days: 7, id: 'se-1573559620', price: 13.17}
{name: 'Fast', days: 4, id: 'se-1573559631', price: 55.25}
{name: 'Expedited', days: 3, id: 'se-1573559630', price: 110.43}

instead of looping through "deliveryoptions",
coming from the views.py, we can hard-code 3 divs in the template,
with just the name, and populate days and price from JS
