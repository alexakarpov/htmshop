list_carriers gets an object, which has "carriers" inside:

>>> se = ShipEngine({"api_key": "TEST_pTjqOjvNiKsTgNXKGtLi1jWEzUuDadyhO4uLfQSzXWw", "page_size": 75, "retries": 3, "timeout": 10})
>>> carriers=se.list_carriers()
>>> ccarriers=carriers.get("carriers")

that would contain what we want:

>>> for c in ccarriers:
...     print(c.get("carrier_code"))
...
...
stamps_com
ups
fedex

----------------------------------------

But we don't need to give customers the carrier choice.

If we fix service_code, e.g.
service_codes": ["usps_media_mail"],

but select multiple carriers, then usps part will only include media, rest will list all

##### Weight ######

p.attributes.filter(product_attribute__name="weight").first().
attribute_value

==============================

task re variants

for each product in the catalog, depending on type, provide choices

icon:
>  mounted icons:
>>  choise of sizes
>  prints:
>>  choise of sizes

incense:
> choice of weight (1lb, 1/2 lb, 1oz)

8x10 weight is 1 pound 13 oz (with bubble-wrap and envelope)

ok
